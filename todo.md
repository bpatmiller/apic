## done
-camera controls
-show velocity field
-extend velocity
-compute density
-compute A,b
-pressure solve
-velocity from pressure gradient
-add affine transform
-fix numerical dissapation (gravity? boundary conditions?) spoiler alert it was something dumb like my sweep functions

## todo
switch to eigen for pressure solve

## further work
-set up partio
-use openVDB
-mesh loading
